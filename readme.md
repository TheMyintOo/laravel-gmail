# Why use this fork
- The original package has been a bit slow in managing development, pull requests, and issues.
- Since we're actively using Laravel Gmail, we decided to maintain it through this fork instead.

# Documentation
Check the original package for the full [documentation](https://github.com/dacastro4/laravel-gmail).

# Contributing
